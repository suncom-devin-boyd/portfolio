          <p>
            In April of 2021, I decided to make a shift from project management
            to software development. I was fortunate to have a solid
            relationship with a systems team patient enough to take me under
            their wing. Today, I am the lead developer responsible for the
            maintainance and enhancement of several critical applications and
            APIs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've spent most of my time developing a heavy Oracle environment as
            a contractor for State Government. I've come to enjoy and appreciate
            the power of PL/SQL, and have learned the capacity for the language
            to accomplish pretty much anything. I am regularly tasked with
            building out React interfaces and middleware tooling. The most
            satisfying moments for me are showcasing the sleek performance of
            systems I build.
          </p>
          <p>
            I currently live in Nagoya, Japan and spend my extra time studying
            Kanji, getting lost in high fantasy, and taking long hikes with my
            favorite podcasts.
